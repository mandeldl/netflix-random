## Netflix Random
Netflix Random is a Chrome Extension that allows you to pick a random movie or show when you're logged in.  Also works on subpages such as **My List**.

## Installation
Until this is up on the Chrome Web Store, the only option is to download from Git, and [load as an unpacked extension in Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)


## Why
Because everyone has experienced the existential crisis that is not knowing which Netflix thing to watch.
