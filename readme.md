## Netflix Random
Netflix Random is a Chrome Extension that allows you to pick a random movie or show when you're logged in.  Also works on subpages such as **My List**.

## Installation
Until this is up on the Chrome Web Store, the only option is to [download from Git](https://github.com/mandeldl/netflix-random/archive/master.zip), and [load as an unpacked extension in Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).  Note that you will have to unzip the file and then select the folder when you're in the file-selection dialog.


## Why
Because everyone has experienced the existential crisis that is not knowing which Netflix thing to watch.
